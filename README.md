# New York Housing Predictor
Final Project for CS539 Machine Learning <br>
By Jack Schnair

## Overview

Give an overview of the project, the data, and the results

## Summary

Whether you're looking to buy or sell, the most common approach to evaluating properties is using a real estate agent. I am to create a model that will allow homeowners or buyers to evalutate the market and come to their own conclusions. My project takes a dataset of properties in New York City and uses machine learning to assess the value of a property based on the property type, area of New York, number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. There are multiple regression models useful for this problem such as linear regression and random forest regression, but catboost has prooved the most accurate due to it's built in functionality to work with categorical data. 

## Project Description:

- First, describe the motivation for the project

- Next, describe what you intended to discover, possibly as a list of aims

- Finally, describe the dataset(s) used in 2-3 sentences, including the source, contents, and size, along with any relevant links

## Methods

Describe the methods used fro the data analysis

## Conclusion

A final section that summarizes the results and conclusions, including any relevant figures/visualizations

(Probably going to be my shiny app)
